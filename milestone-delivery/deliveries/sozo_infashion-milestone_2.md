| ------ | ----------------|--- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.     | Documentation   |[API Documentation](https://github.com/KShervington/sozo-app/blob/main/docs/api.md) | Comprehensive API documentation for Sozo inFashion platform, detailing REST endpoints for users, products, wallets, and purchases. It provides developers with endpoint specifications, request/response formats, and examples for seamless integration with the platform's features.|
| 2.     | Custom Backend (Instead of back4app)   |[Backend](https://github.com/KShervington/sozo-app/tree/main/apps/backend) | We created a custom backend for the Sozo inFashion project, designed to meet specific business requirements with enhanced flexibility and control. This custom solution supports complex workflows, integrates seamlessly with blockchain technology, and ensures robust data security and performance optimization. Unlike Back4App, which offers generic backend services, a custom backend allows for tailored features, such as advanced data processing, specialized API endpoints, and precise scalability options. This approach empowers Sozo inFashion to innovate rapidly, maintain full ownership of its infrastructure, and deliver a unique, high-performance experience to its users. |
| 3.     | Smart Contracts |[Contracts](https://github.com/KShervington/sozo-app/tree/main/apps/backend/contracts) | The Sozo application leverages VeChain's blockchain to create digital certificates of authenticity for fashion items through NFTs. The SozoNFT smart contract, built on ERC721 standards, mints unique tokens that link physical products to their digital representations. Each NFT contains a product ID and URI, establishing an immutable record of ownership and authenticity. The contract enables secure transfer of ownership while maintaining the product's digital history. This blockchain integration ensures transparency in the fashion supply chain and empowers consumers to verify the authenticity of their purchases.|
| 4.     | UI              |[Frontend](https://github.com/KShervington/sozo-app/tree/main/apps/frontend) | The Sozo frontend application is a modern, user-friendly interface built with React and TypeScript to showcase the functionality of the Sozo backend infrastructure.|
| 5.     | Unit Testing    |[Testing](https://github.com/KShervington/sozo-app/blob/main/apps/backend/src/tests/test.ts) | Our test suite forms the backbone of quality assurance for the SoZo platform. It comprehensively validates four critical components: user management, product listings, wallet operations, and purchase transactions. The tests ensure secure user creation with wallet integration, proper product listing management, accurate wallet balance handling, and reliable purchase flows. Through systematic API endpoint testing and proper database cleanup, it maintains data integrity and validates the core business logic. This testing infrastructure is crucial for preventing regressions and ensuring reliable marketplace operations in a blockchain context.|
